# Badly made Tetris

Absolutely gross implementation of Tetris. Especially line piece rotate is completely messed up. It shouldn't crash but it in no way conforms with Tetris standard. Looking at the code will probably cause nightmares. Should have planned the whole thing better, but in the end it works, kinda..
